### BUA 455 Dashboard Group Project

#### First Task Proposal

### Why Proposals are Important

- As a data analyst, you have skills that others don't.

- In this class you are learning to aquire, combine, manage, and present data

- In MAS 261, BUA 345, BUA 451 (Advanced Analytics), and additional electives, you learn to analyze and interpret data

- These skills are unique and are useful to your colleagues and clients BUT you will spend your career (over and over) selling and explaining your skillset.

- In most cases, people you work with or work for will NOT know how your skills can help them.
  
- It is your role to help them understand:

  - what questions can be answered with data

  - what data will help them answer their questions and how to get it.
  
  - How data management and analyses can help them and may likely be essential to their goals
  
---

### Where the Proposal Process fits Wthin this course
    
- This course limits the scope to data aquisition, management, and presentation
  
- Within that scope, there is much that can be learned from combining data sources even without analysis.
  
- Aside from this course, you will learn increasingly more interesting and complex analytical methods.
  
- The more methods and concepts you know, the better prepared you are to deal with any data you encounter.
  
- BUT...No matter how much you know, the majority of you time will be spent using the skills from this course.
  
- Depending on your work environment and position, others may be assigned time consuming repetitive data management tasks by you BUT 
  
  - You should still direct the data management and presentation work because you will be held responsible
    
  - File management, data management, data curation and presentation should all complement and augment analyses.
  
---

#### Groups Assigned

**Proposal Rough Draft - Due Monday, 10/24, at 7:00 PM (No Grace Period)**
   
The rough draft does not need to be more than a couple paragraphs and should answer these questions:

**What data does your group plan to work with?**

- You should have an idea of your topic (okay to be unsure and/or need guidance at pre-poposal stage)

- You should have done a little exploration

- Rough draft proposal should include links to specific data sources that might work.

**What questions do you think you want to answer? **

- You can start by looking at relevant financial data and other data to brainstorm ideas

- Database searches on **Statista** might be helpful.

  - **Statista** is a great starting point, but your project should go beyond these small datasets.

- **Note:** If you are interested in **sports** data or **billboard music** data and don't know how to webscrape, I can help.
  - Your project is doable, but data management will take more time and you should start now.
  
---

**Proposal Final Draft - Due Monday, at midnight (1 Day Grace Period)**

- The final proposal draft should be 1-2 pages (double spaced, 12 pt. font). 

- In consulting, the goal of the proposal is to "sell" your skillset.

- You want to convince the prospective client to trust you with their data and pay for your expertise.

- The goal is to explain in non-technical language why your dashboard will be useful.

  - How will you provide information that the (hypothetical) client wouldn't have otherwise?
  
  - List tentative goals that you hope to achieve and ideas for how to acheive them.

  - How will the client be able to use that information?
    
- Although your client(s) are hypothetical, it helps to envision who your target client is.
    
  - How will they use this information to change 
    
    - their marketing plan?
      
    - their purchasing and staffing plan?
      
    - their overall investment strategy?
      
    - their supply chain strategy?
      
    - another aspect of their business?
        
---

### Proposals are **TENTATIVE** Agreements to do work

- Understandably, the work is not yet done, so your plans may change, which is okay.

- You are, most likely, not ready to make plots, but you can describe or sketch out plots that might work.

  - It is actually better not to provide final work products at proposal stage, but ideas and plots should be polished enough to entice client.

- A good proposal shows that you have creative ideas and have put some thought into how you can help the client.

- If possible show explicit links between each question or goal you plan to address and the possible component of the dashboard that addresses it.

- Again, it is okay if your plans change based on what you discover in the data.

  - In real life, proposals and client goals are more concrete, but in this course, I encourage you to experiment.

### Introduction of HW 5 - Part 1 Data

#### Today: Examine and clean data

- First step is to import and examine data

- Look for quirks that might be a challenge

  - Hint: Examine `date_added` column in the .csv file or in R


```r
# import data and examine
nflx &lt;- read_csv("netflix_titles.csv", show_col_types=F) |&gt; glimpse()
```

```
## Rows: 8,807
## Columns: 12

### Week 8 In-class Exercises (TP L13 - Q1)

***PointSolutions Session ID: bua455s22***

How many different date formats do you see in the date_added column?

&lt;br&gt;

### Week 8 In-class Exercises (TP L13 - Q2)

***PointSolutions Session ID: bua455s22***

How many different commands are required to convert the date_added column to a date variable?

---

### Cleaning These Data

#### New command for dealing with text data: `separate`

#### Review of `lubridate` commands

- Next steps:
  - Select variables 
  - use separate to split `listed_in` into 3 columns (Why?)
  - Convert `date_added` to a date variable and then create a year variable
  

```r
nflx &lt;- nflx |&gt;
  select(show_id, type, date_added, release_year, rating, listed_in) |&gt; # useful variables (subjective)

  separate(listed_in, sep=",", into=c("g1", "g2", "g3")) |&gt;         # separate out genre listings 
                                                                    # will result in lots of NAs
  mutate(date_added = mdy(date_added),                              # convert data_added to a date var
         year_added = year(date_added))                             # create a separate year var
```

---

class: middle

### Week 8 In-class Exercises (TP L13 - Q3)

***PointSolutions Session ID: bua455s22***

`separate` is the reverse of an R command we have already learned.  What command is that?

---

### Preliminary Cleaning Completed

- The previous steps are the most basic low-hanging fruit.

- Even those steps may be edited and re-edited after looking at the data more carefully.

  Data cleaning is almost always iterative and altered for different goals.

- For example, do we need the `show_id`?  

  - As a general rule, keep unique row identifiers (or make a simpler one) until all management work is done.
  
---

### Data Exploration and Additional Cleaning

#### Finding and Removing Data with Missing Values (Depends on Subject Matter)

Are there observations for which `year_added` is missing (`NA`)? 
   
   - **Cool trick:** `is.na(nflx$year_added)` will create a vector of `FALSE` and `TRUE` values
   
     - `FALSE` unless the observation value is `NA`
   
     - R interprets `FALSE` as 0 and `TRUE` as 1 so you can sum this vector to find number of missing values
   


```r
sum(is.na(nflx$year_added))                # number of missing values (there are 10)
table(is.na(nflx$year_added))              # could also summarize with table
nflx &lt;- nflx |&gt; filter(!is.na(year_added)) # remove NA's and check again
sum(is.na(nflx$year_added))
```

```
## [1] 10
## 
## FALSE  TRUE 
##  8797    10 
## [1] 0
```

---

### Data Exploration and Additional Cleaning

#### Excluding **Rare** Categories (Depends on Subject Matter)

Are there observations for which rating is `NR` (not-rated) or `UR` (un-rated)?

- If so, we delete them because we are restricting our data to more common categories.
- Remainder of the categories can be grouped logically, but these are 'oddball' categories


```r
table(nflx$rating) # examine categories
nflx &lt;- nflx |&gt; filter(!rating %in% c("NR", "UR"))
table(nflx$rating) # examine again after filter
```

```
## 
##        G    NC-17       NR       PG    PG-13        R    TV-14     TV-G 
##       41        3       79      287      491      799     2158      220 
##    TV-MA    TV-PG     TV-Y    TV-Y7 TV-Y7-FV       UR 
##     3209      862      306      333        6        3 
## 
##        G    NC-17       PG    PG-13        R    TV-14     TV-G    TV-MA 
##       41        3      287      491      799     2158      220     3209 
##    TV-PG     TV-Y    TV-Y7 TV-Y7-FV 
##      862      306      333        6
```

### When can you delete data?

- If you find raw uncleaned data on the internet or are given data by a client or co-worker, is it okay to delete observations?
- Yes, under certain circumstances.  

  1.  You must be completely transparent about how you are limiting the data and why.
  
      - For example, I am limiting these data to specific time periods and specific genres.
      - Other time and genre categories have too little data.
      
  2. You should never delete outliers or unusual observations unless you can confirm they are errors or are not part of the data you are studying.

- I am simplifying the data by removing categories that are not of primary interest.  
- Someone else might choose different categories and limit the data differently.
- Always be transparent about data sources and all decisions you make.
   
---

### Data Exploration and Additional Cleaning

#### Modifying text or numeric variables with `ifelse`

- Numeric or text data can be converted to a categorical variable with a set of explicit `ifelse` statements.

- `ifelse` is not the ONLY way to categorize data, but it's my tool of choice.

- The input values for `ifelse` are ALWAYS the same:

  - Input 1: a test where result is `TRUE` or `FALSE`.
  - Input 2: output value if the test result is `TRUE`.
  - Input 3:output value if the test result is `FALSE`.


```r
x &lt;- seq(9,90,9)    # create var x that is a sequence of values
(d &lt;- tibble(x))    # convert x to a tibble (dataset) 
(d &lt;- d |&gt; mutate(y = ifelse(x &lt; 35, "Low", NA))) # add variable y to dataset d
(d &lt;- d |&gt; mutate(y = ifelse(x &gt;= 35 &amp; x &lt; 65, "Medium", y))) 
(d &lt;- d |&gt; mutate(y = ifelse(x &gt;= 65, "High", y)))           
```

---

### Data Exploration and Additional Cleaning

#### Modifying text multiple `ifelse` statements

- The previous example can be (and should be) condensed into one mutate statement as shown here.


```r
# create a dataset with 1 variable
x &lt;- seq(9,90,9)
d &lt;- tibble(x)
d &lt;- d |&gt; mutate(y = ifelse(x &lt; 35, "Low", NA),                         
                  y = ifelse(x &gt;= 35 &amp; x &lt; 65, "Medium", y),
                  y = ifelse(x &gt;= 65, "High", y),
                  yF = factor(y, levels = c("Low", "Medium", "High"))) |&gt; 
                                  # levels is used to specify correct order
glimpse()
```

```
## Rows: 10
## Columns: 3
## $ x  &lt;dbl&gt; 9, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90
## $ y  &lt;chr&gt; "Low", "Low", "Low", "Medium", "Medium", "Medium", "Medium", "High"…
## $ yF &lt;fct&gt; Low, Low, Low, Medium, Medium, Medium, Medium, High, High, High
```

---

### Week 8 IN-class Exercise 1

- We will examine the Netflix ratings data again and simplify the categories to reflect minimum appropriate ages.

- In this case, I have done some research on what these ratings mean.  

- In your projects, you will be expected to understand the values in your variables

  - You are likely to have to simplify your data categories for your data management goals.

- My proposed solution for these data:  

  - Categorize both TV shows and Movies into Four minimum age categories: 0, 7, 13, 17

  - Minimum Age 0: "G", "TV-G", "TV-Y"
  
  - Minimum Age 7: "PG", "TV-PG", "TV-Y7", "TV-Y7-FV"
  
  - Minimum Age 13: "PG-13", "TV-14"
  
  - Minimum Age 17: "NC-17", "TV-MA", "R"
  
---

What we will do today:

- Together we will fill in the blanks in the R chunk below 

  - You will submit the entire chunk (with your added comments) on Blackboard.
  
    - Copy it into empty text file provided and save it with your name
  
  - This counts towards class participation for Tuesday, 10/18 and due by Wednesday 3/23 at midnight.
  





```r
table(nflx$rating)
```

```
## 
##        G    NC-17       PG    PG-13        R    TV-14     TV-G    TV-MA 
##       41        3      287      491      799     2158      220     3209 
##    TV-PG     TV-Y    TV-Y7 TV-Y7-FV 
##      862      306      333        6
```

```r
# nflx &lt;- nflx |&gt;
#   mutate(min_age = ifelse(rating %in% c("G", "TV-G", "TV-Y"), 0, ____),
#          min_age = ifelse(rating %in% c("PG", "TV-PG", "TV-Y7", "TV-Y7-FV"), 7, _____),
#          min_age = ifelse(rating %in% c("PG-13", "TV-14"), ____, ____),
#          min_age = ifelse())

# table(nflx$min_age)
```

---

#### Another `ifelse` Example

- We can use a similar technique to categorize when shows or movies were first shown (released).

- This code is very similar to our simple numerical example shown previously.

- In HW 5 (which will be posted on Thursday) you will:

  - Filter data to remove releases from before 1981
  
  - Group releases from 2001-2005 and 2006-2010 into one period, 2001-2010


```r
#table(nflx$release_year)

nflx &lt;- nflx |&gt;
  mutate(release_period = ifelse(release_year &lt;= 1980, "1925-1980", NA),
         release_period = ifelse(release_year &gt; 1980 &amp; release_year &lt;= 2000, "1981-2000", release_period),
         release_period = ifelse(release_year &gt; 2000 &amp; release_year &lt;= 2005, "2001-2005", release_period),
         release_period = ifelse(release_year &gt; 2005 &amp; release_year &lt;= 2010, "2006-2010", release_period),
         release_period = ifelse(release_year &gt; 2010 &amp; release_year &lt;= 2015, "2011-2015", release_period),
         release_period = ifelse(release_year &gt; 2015, "2016-2021", release_period))

table(nflx$release_period)
```

```
## 
## 1925-1980 1981-2000 2001-2005 2006-2010 2011-2015 2016-2021 
##       130       424       297       656      1578      5630
```

### Cleaning Text Variables

- The code that follows **WILL NOT RUN** until the `min_age` and `release_period` variables are created (previous chunks).

- The next steps are tedious, but important, and will be different for every dataset you encounter.

- On a quiz you should know how to use these text commands: 

  - `gsub`, `str_trim`, 
  
  - `separate`, `paste`, 
  
  - `tolower`, `toupper`,
  
  - `ifelse` which is also used elsewhere
  
&lt;br&gt;
  
  - Not required but useful: use `?str_trim` to see also `str_squish` and `str_pad`

---

### Week 8 In-class Exercises (TP L14 - Q1)

***PointSolutions Session ID: bua455s22***

`str_trim` is used in an upcoming chunk to trim spaces before characters in some observations.

Can `gsub` also be used for this purpose?

&lt;br&gt;

### Week 8 In-class Exercises (TP L14 - Q2)

***PointSolutions Session ID: bua455s22***

Type `?tolower` into the console to bring up the help file for this command and `toupper`.

Copy and paste these lines into the console:

```
tolower("WhAT is the Result of this Command?")

toupper("WhAT is the Result of this Command?")

```

---

### Multi-step Process to clean genre

- Reshape data with `pivot_longer` and convert all text to lower case with `to_lower`

- Examine in console using this command: `cbind(table(nflx$genre))`


```r
nflx &lt;- nflx |&gt;
  select(show_id, type, year_added, release_period, min_age, g1, g2, g3) |&gt;
  pivot_longer(cols=c("g1","g2","g3"), names_to="g", values_to="genre") # g is a place holder

nflx &lt;- nflx |&gt; select(!g) |&gt; mutate(genre=tolower(genre)) |&gt; glimpse()
```

```
## Rows: 26,145
## Columns: 6
## $ show_id        &lt;chr&gt; "s6785", "s6785", "s6785", "s8456", "s8456", "s8456", "…
## $ type           &lt;chr&gt; "Movie", "Movie", "Movie", "Movie", "Movie", "Movie", "…
## $ year_added     &lt;dbl&gt; 2019, 2019, 2019, 2014, 2014, 2014, 2015, 2015, 2015, 2…
## $ release_period &lt;chr&gt; "1925-1980", "1925-1980", "1925-1980", "2011-2015", "20…
## $ min_age        &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0…
## $ genre          &lt;chr&gt; "action &amp; adventure", " classic movies", " sci-fi &amp; fan…
```

### Multi-step Process to clean genre

.pull-left[

- Remove leading spaces with `str_trim`

- Examine in console using this command: `cbind(table(nflx$genre))`


```r
# remove leading space
nflx &lt;- nflx |&gt; mutate(genre = str_trim(genre))
```


]

.pull-right[

![](docs_files/images/owl.png)

---

### Remove Unnecessary Text

- This text is unnecessary and redundant because of `type` variabel in data.

- Examine in console using this command: `cbind(table(nflx$genre))`


```r
# remove the text `movies` and `tv shows` and `tv` from genre names
nflx &lt;- nflx |&gt;
  mutate(genre = gsub(" movies", "", genre),
         genre = gsub("movies", "", genre),
         genre = gsub(" tv shows", "", genre),
         genre = gsub("tv shows", "", genre),
         genre = gsub("tv ", "", genre),
         genre = gsub(" tv", "", genre))
```

---

### Consolidate `genre` Categories using `ifelse`

- Below I am only editing and consolidating categories I plan to use.

- Examine in console using this command: `cbind(table(nflx$genre))`


```r
nflx &lt;- nflx |&gt;
  mutate(genre = ifelse(genre == "drama", "dramas", genre),
         
         genre = ifelse(genre %in% c("stand-up comedy", 
                                     "stand-up comedy &amp; talk shows"), 
                        "comedies", genre),

         genre = ifelse(genre %in% c("documentaries", "docuseries"), 
                        "docs", genre),
         
         genre = ifelse(genre %in% c("children &amp; family", "kids'"), 
                        "kids", genre),

         genre = gsub("action &amp; adventure", "action_adventr", genre))
```

### Filter Data to Genres of Interest

.pull-left[

- Examine in console using this command: `cbind(table(nflx$genre))`

- Examine in console using this command: `table(nflx$type, nflx$genre)`


```r
nflx &lt;- nflx |&gt;

### Create Final Summary Dataset

In HW 5 - Part 1, Students will create and use `nflx_mv`, the movies observations from these data.


```r
nflx &lt;- nflx |&gt;                            
  group_by(type, release_period, year_added, min_age, genre) |&gt;
  summarize(n = n()) |&gt;                   # n() tallies number of obs       
  pivot_wider(id_cols = c(type, release_period, year_added, min_age), # col. for each genre
              names_from = genre, 
              values_from = n)

nflx[is.na(nflx)] &lt;- 0                                          # why should NA's be 0 here?
nflx_tv &lt;- nflx |&gt;                                              # example dashboard  made from nflx tv
  filter(type == "TV Show") 

# nflx_mv &lt;- 
```
